# Validator Testing #

- HTML
![html validator]()
As the example above will show i have encontered some warning after the validation. 
I have fixed all the warning and gotten raid of all the errors on all pages .
The process was easy as the issues i had were that i had used the same section and section id for multiples elements , to fix this i changed all the affected id with classes and that solved the issues.
- CSS
When validating through the (jigsaw) validator my issues were the fact that ==font-family: "roboto sans-serif";== was written as ==font-family: roboto sans-serif;==
To fix this i only had to add the "" to the proprety values.

- Accesibility
I have confirmed that all the accesibilitty criterias were meet for all pages as shown in the lighthouse reports below .
